## Essential Questions

- What is the best way to approach new software?
- What is recursion and why is it useful?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson in is three-fold! First, to act as a concrete example of
what I consider to be a "good" lesson given the previous fundamentals of
teaching lesson. Second, I believe that PRIMM will serve as a useful paradigm
for how programmers will interact with ChatBots in the future. Finally, I will
use the opportunity as a way to introduce recursion for those who haven't taken
AP yet.

### Setup

- Recursion worksheet printed out
- Recursion code posted to Schoology

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Types of learning for humans
    - Types of learning for machines
- PRIMM
    - What it is
    - Why it's effective
    - Biggest hurdle at "make"
- Examples of PRIMM
    - http://code-it.co.uk/gold/
    - Function worksheet from HS
- Experiencing PRIMM
    - Who knows what recursion is?
    - Explain
    - Explain via PRIMM
        - Simple counting example
- How does PRIMM match your experience?
    - In past classes?
    - In the way you learn to code?
    - In your interactions with ChatBots?
    - In debugging?
    - In comparison with the "science of learning" document
- Thoughts on PRIMM (soap box)
    - Assumption that some people are just good at software... not true!
    - Way to be good is to approach problems with a structured approach
    - Enact PRIMM whenever encountering a problem that you think is intractable
        - Useful way to slowly chip away at a problem w/o feeling swamped
- Worksheet on recursion
    - Walk through worksheet
    - Quickly walk through source code
    - How to kill the turtle screen
        - Kill the terminal via the trash can
    - Go!
- Reflection
    - What's good?
    - What's bad?
    - What matches best practice?
