## Essential Questions

- What is the best way to approach new software?
- What is recursion and why is it useful?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson is three-fold. To present PRIMM, which I believe is a
useful model for approaching/debugging new software. Being 
become a model for how programmers will interact with ChatBots in the future.
In addition, I will use the discussion of it as a way to introduce recursion,
something that will be necessary in later parts of the class (which many of
the students have no experience in).
