- How does human learning compare to machine learning?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

Printed out discussion rubrics

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement)
    - Types of classifiers (bayesian, decision trees)
    - Properties of trees
    - Training set
    - Test set
    - Overfitting
- Today going to have a discussion
    - Hand out discussion rubric
    - Have read through it and ask any questions
- Write for 5m answering one of the essential questions:
    - How does the research compare with your learning experience?
    - Which techniques have comparable ones in machine learning?
     - Which techniques have no comparable ones in ML and what does this say
       about the difference between humans and machines?
- Ground rules
    - Think of positive examples
    - Listen
- Begin discussion
- Wrap up
    - Ask someone to summarize
    - Ask if there's anything that wasn't said
- Debrief
    - Self-assess on the rubric
    - Answer questions on the back
