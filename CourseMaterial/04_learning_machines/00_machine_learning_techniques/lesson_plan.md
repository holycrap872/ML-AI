## Essential Questions

- How can we use our experience at lab to understand what learning is?
- What ways do I/you learn best?

## Lesson Plan

- Going to enter philosophy on learning
- Learning unit will be two parts:
    - Given a specific type of problem, how do we best teach machines?
    - Given a specific type of problem, how do we best teach humans?
- Humans aren't machines
    - What are the similarities in techniques?
    - What are the differences?
- Three basic types of machine learning
    - Just look at two first: supervised vs. unsupervised:

- Give examples and determine what kind of training:

    - ??? example of unsupervised learning ???
- Reinforcement learning
    - Fun one!

    - Evolutionary
- How does this relate to learning?
    - 

Neural networks require back propogation (sleep?)
