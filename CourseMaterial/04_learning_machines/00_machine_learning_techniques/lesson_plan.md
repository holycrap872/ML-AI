## Essential Questions

- What does it mean for a machine to learn?
- What are the core machine learning techniques?
- Where are each of these techniques most effective?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Weka installed
- Weka's `userClassifer` plugin installed
- `segment-test.arff` and `segment-challenge.arff` in Schoology

### Actual Lesson

#### Day 1

- Going to enter brief section on "Philosophy of Learning"
- Learning unit will be two parts:
    - Given a specific type of problem, how do we best teach machines?
    - Given a specific type of problem, how do we best teach humans?
- What do we know about machine learning?
    - Data and stats
- Three basic types of learning:
    - Supervised
    - Reinforcement
    - Unsupervised
- Supervised:

    - Go through lesson 6
    - Silly, but gets the point across
- Debrief supervised
    - Labeled/Tagged data
- Reinforcement

        - 0:00 - 3:30
    - Tons of videos on youtube like this
- Debrief reinforcement
    - Formula/function
    - Akin to evolution
- Unsupervised
    - K-means clustering
    - Somethings here... up to the expert
- Continuum of effort:
    - Supervised high human effort, unsupervised low effort
- Handling data
    - Overfitting
- Name that learning style:
    - Weather prediction -> Supervised
    - Evolution -> Reinforcement
    - Captchas -> Supervised
    - Rubrics -> Reinforcement
    - Journaling -> Unsupervised
    - Handwriting recognition -> Supervised
    - LLMs -> Unsupervised
    - Credit checks -> Supervised
- Vocab words:
    - Machine learning
    - Supervised learning
    - Unsupervised learning
    - Reinforcement learning
    - Labeled data
    - Overfitting
    - Classifier
    - Agent
    - Clusters
    - Training Set
    - Test Set
