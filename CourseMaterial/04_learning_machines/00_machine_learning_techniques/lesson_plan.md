## Essential Questions

- What does it mean for a machine to learn?
- What are the core machine learning techniques?
- Where are each of these techniques most effective?

## Lesson Plan

- Going to enter philosophy on learning
- Learning unit will be two parts:
    - Given a specific type of problem, how do we best teach machines?
    - Given a specific type of problem, how do we best teach humans?
- Learning discussion
    - Set expectations
    - Read short article
        - Have "questions to ponder" while read
            - TODO: What does it mean for a machine to learn?
            - TODO: What examples have we seen of machines learning in this class?
            - TODO: What is missing in our examples so far?
            - TODO: 
- Three basic types of machine learning
    - Just look at two first: supervised vs. unsupervised:

- Give examples and determine what kind of training:

    - ??? example of unsupervised learning ???
- Reinforcement learning
    - Fun one!

    - Evolutionary
- How does this relate to learning?
    - 

Neural networks require back propogation (sleep?)
