## Essential Questions

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Bunch of sets of legos with big flat piece to stick them to
- Dividers

### Actual Lesson

- Today going to play a game called search space battle ship
    - Who's played battle ship?
- Most of ML/AI is trying to find the best possible solution
    - Set the parameters (in this case x,y)
    - looking for a "local maxima"
    - Bunch of alogrithms to do this, but lets see what you come up with
- Rules
    - Need to use all your legos
    - Must have a "peak" of height 5 that other person is trying to find
- Let play and debrief
    - What were people's strategies?
    - What was the hardest solution to find?
- Reset
    - Must have a slope of one going up to height 5
- Let play and debrief
    - Gradient descent (ascent) in our case

### Homework

- Research "simulated annealing" and explain what it's strategy would be
