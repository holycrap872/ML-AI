## EQ's

- What do we want to remember?
- What do we actually remember?

## Lesson Plan

This is the first attempt at being technical in the class. The goal is to
figure out where the students along several dimensions.

1. How well do they setup a project's environment?
2. How much do they remember about programming?
3. What other things do I not know about

### Setup

- Worksheet printed out

### Actual Lesson

1. Create a function that asks for the user's name and then prints out a greeting.
    - `Shows use of input`
    - Ability to run a program
    - Ability to create/use a function

2. Create a program that take three numbers from a user and prints out the max.
    - Conditionals
    - type conversion

3. Write a function that determines if a given number is a prime.
    - Algorithms
    - Loops

4. Create a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.
    - Algorithms
    - Various accesses in a list

5. Create a function that produces the intersection of two lists. Create at
   least four tests.
    - Multiple lists
    - List creation
    - Unit testing

6. Create a function that merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list and
   create tests.
    - Algorithms
    - Sorting
    - Assertions

7. Create a function that takes two strings as inputs and determines if they are
   anagrams. Write enough tests such that you have 100% line coverage.

8. Develop a function that calculates the score of a given word in a Scrabble
   game. Write enough tests such that you have 100% line coverage.

9. Implement a basic linked lista data struction with functions for (insert,
   deletion, and "contains")
