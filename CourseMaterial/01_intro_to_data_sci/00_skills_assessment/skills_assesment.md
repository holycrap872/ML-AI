## Python Skills Assessment

This skills assessment is intended to determine where you are as a programmer.
You **will not** be graded for how many of these problems your get right. All
that matters is that you approach this problem set with a problem solving
attitude and try to apply your past learnings to get as far as you can.


For each problem, create a new function and then call that function from the
`__main__` hook. Once you have completed the problem, comment it out out and
move onto the next one.

For example:

```python3
def say_hi():
    ...


def max_of_three():
    ...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # say_hi()
    max_of_three()

```

### Problems

0. Create a function that asks for the user's name and then prints out a greeting.
1. Create a function that take three numbers from a user and prints out the max.
2. Write a function that determines if a given number is a prime.
3. Create a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.
4. Create a function that produces the intersection of two lists. Create at
   least four unit tests.
5. Create a function that merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list and
   create at least four unit tests.
6. Create a function that takes two strings as inputs and determines if they are
   anagrams. Write enough unit tests such that you have 100% line coverage.
7. Develop a function that calculates the score of a given word in a Scrabble
   game. Write enough unit tests such that you have 100% line coverage.
8. Implement a basic linked lista data struction with functions for (insert,
   deletion, and "contains")
