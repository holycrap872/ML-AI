# Nerd Dice

20-sided dice are common in various "role playing games" such as Dungeons and
Dragons. The question you're going to analyze today is: what if you forgot
your lucky 20-sided die? Can you replace it with two 10-sided dice?

## Steps

1. Create a function to return a random number between 1 - 20
2. Run 10,000 experiments where you record the result of rolling a 20-sided die
3. Graph the results using a bar graph. Have the numbers 1 - 20 along the
   x-axis and have the height of each bar represent the number of rolls that
   had that value
4. Create a function to return the **sum** of two random numbers between 1 - 10
5. Run 10,000 experiments where you record the result of rolling two 10-sided dice
6. Graph the results using a bar graph. Have the numbers 1 - 20 along the
   x-axis and have the height of each bar represent the number of rolls that
   had that value
