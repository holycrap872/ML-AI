### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Libraries
    - Installing libraries
    - Show documentation for libraries
- Today going to graph the monte carlo method
- Anyone heard of monte carlo analysis?
    - Bunch of random points
    - Demonstrate by drawing a duck on a piece of paper and dropping pencil
    - Can be used to find very good approximation of very difficult shapes
        - Find percentage that particular shape takes up of space
        - If know area of space, then can also find area of shape
- For example
    - Find area under x^2 curve
    - How would we do this?
        - Plan out/discuss together
    - Show code and run
    - That's calculus!
- Today going to do Monte Carlo area of a circle
    - How would we do this?
        - Plan out/discuss together
