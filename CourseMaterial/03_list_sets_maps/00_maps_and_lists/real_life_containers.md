## Real Life Data Structures

For each of the following situations, identify what data structure would be
most useful and give an example (in python) of the data it would store.

For example:
- Situation: You are creating a system for a library. For each book, you want
  to store its title and the number of copies available.
- Storage type: Dictionary of string to int
- Code Example: `library_books = {"Little Women": 5, "Great Gatsby": 3}`
