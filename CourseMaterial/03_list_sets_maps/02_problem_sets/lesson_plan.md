## Lesson Plan

Show common "counting" pattern

## Problem Sets

- Simple, w/o any data processing
    - Maps
        - Program that counts number of words in a text (maps)
        - Program that creates index (GrammaTech problem)
        - Create a function that returns the first non-repeated character in a string.
        - Given a dictionary and a key, write a function to recursively fetch the value for the nested key.
            - `{"a": {"b": {"c": "d"}}}, "a/b/c"` -> "d"
    - Sets
        - Check if one set is a subset of another
        - Check for duplicates in a list
        - Intersection of a set
    - Lists
        - Give an list, function to return the index of the second largest number.
        - Reverse the strings in a list of strings
            - ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] -> ["elppa", "ananab", "yrrehc"]
        - Takes a list of numbers and returns the list without any duplicates, preserving the original order
