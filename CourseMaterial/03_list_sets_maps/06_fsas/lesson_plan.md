#### Day 3

- Reflection
    - FSA formalizations
    - Where are FSAs used?
- Today going to combine a few things at once
    - FSAs
    - Debugging
- Walk-through
    - Show schema
    - Show me running it
    - Explain what the issues are
- Find the bugs!
    - What are techniques we can use to debug?
        - Adding types
        - Unit tests
        - `print()` statements
            - Often the most useful
