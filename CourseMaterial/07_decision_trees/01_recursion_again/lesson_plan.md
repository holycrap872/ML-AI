## Essential Questions

- What is recursion and why is it useful?
- How does recursion compare to an iterative program?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Youtube videos loaded and ready to go
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q83nN97LVOU
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf60MejMz3E

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Recursion
    - Function pause
- Watch videos
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q83nN97LVOU
        - 0:00 - 3:14

        - 0:00 - end
- Remove elements from a list
    - Do iteratively
    - Do recursively
    - Sometimes thinking recursively better, sometime iteratively better
    - Good to have both techniques in tool belt
- Continue with worksheet
    - Homework is to finish
