## Essential Questions

- What is recursion and why is it useful?
- How does recursion compare to an iterative program?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- `ml_ai_recursion_worksheet` pushed to Schoology
- Youtube videos loaded and ready to go
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q83nN97LVOU
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf60MejMz3E

### Actual Lesson

#### Day 1

- AI in Society wrap up
    - Drake's Equation
    - Fermi's Paradox
        - One possibility is that technology got so advanced they destroyed themselves
            - Paperclips
        - Another is that technology got so advanced that could create perfect world w/o exploration
            - Her
    - Not really answerable, but worth wrestling with
- Switching units to one about trees
    - Going to start with recursion
    - Who's heard of recursion?
- Definition of recursion
    - When the definition of a concept or process depends on a simpler or previous version of itself.
    - Base case
    - Recursive step
- Examples of recursion in nature
    - Ferns
    - Tree
    - Brocolli
- How a function works
    - Pause higher level
    - Finish lower level
    - Return with answer
    - Continue higher level
- Example of recursion with `recursive_remove_character.py`
    - Use debugger
    - Show various possible call stacks
- Example of recursion with `recursive_fib_sequence.py`
    - Use debugger
    - Show various possible call stacks
- Explain worksheet
    - Check that everyone can use turtles
    - If can't use turtles, have use Grok
- Go!

#### Day 2

- Review
    - Recursion
    - Function pause
- Watch videos
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q83nN97LVOU
        - 0:00 - 3:14
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rf60MejMz3E
        - 0:00 - end
- Remove elements from a list
    - Do iteratively
    - Do recursively
    - Sometimes thinking recursively better, sometime iteratively better
    - Good to have both techniques in tool belt
- Continue with worksheet
    - Homework is to finish


#### Day 3

- Review
    - Recursion
    - Go over homework
