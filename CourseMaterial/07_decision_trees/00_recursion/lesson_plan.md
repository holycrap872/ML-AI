## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- `ml_ai_recursion_worksheet` pushed to Schoology

### Actual Lesson

- AI in Society wrap up
    - Drake's Equation
    - Fermi's Paradox
        - One possibility is that technology got so advanced they destroyed themselves
            - Paperclips
        - Another is that technology got so advanced that could create perfect world w/o exploration
            - Her
    - Not really answerable, but worth wrestling with
- Switching units to one about trees
    - Going to start with recursion
    - Who's heard of recursion?
- Definition of recursion
    - When the definition of a concept or process depends on a simpler or previous version of itself.
    - Base case
    - Recursive step
- Examples of recursion in nature
    - Ferns
    - Tree
    - Broccoli
- How a function works
    - Pause higher level
    - Finish lower level
    - Return with answer
    - Continue higher level
- Example of recursion with `recursive_remove_character.py`
    - Use debugger
    - Show various possible call stacks
- Example of recursion with `recursive_fib_sequence.py`
    - Use debugger
