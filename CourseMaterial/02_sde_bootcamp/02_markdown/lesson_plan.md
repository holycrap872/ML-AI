## Essential Questions

- What practices can I adopt to make my knowledge easily viewable and sharable?

## Lesson Plan

The goal here is to move from local git to a deployed repository. Then, with
their first commit, students will create a markdown README for a `Today I Learned`
project that they will add to over time.

> Student's normal creds work (LDAP) automatically work with GitLab

### Setup

None unless you want to use a "class group"

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - `git` is just a bunch of diffs
    - staged changes vs. unstaged changes
- Today going to push `git` to the cloud
    - Show some examples in github
        - angr
        - Josh's TIL
        - Look at commits to see what's going on
    - Every good project has a README
        - README is in markdown
        - Basically opposite of mark up
        - Show raw file vs. rendered file
    - https://stackedit.io/app#
        - Have them experiment for a while
        - Bold, headings 1 - 2 - 3, ordered lists, unordered lists, notes
    - Goal today:
        - Create a TIL repo
            - Going to be adding to it over the course of the term
        - First commit is a README.md explaining what is going on
        - Second commit is a commit about what you learned about the turing test
    - Go
