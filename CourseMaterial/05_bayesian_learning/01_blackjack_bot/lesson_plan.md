## Essential Questions

- How can we use the past to predict the future?
- How can we use feedback to create a learning system?

## Lesson Plan

The point of this lesson is to have the students start to program larger systems
beyond the pointed worksheets/lessons I've been giving them up to this point.
This will allow them to start to decompose problems better.

The fact that it is blackjack game allows for them to build a system them mostly
know without having to constantly check in with me.

### Setup

- One deck of cards for every two students

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - What was easy?
    - What was hard?
    - How did ChatBots help with our design?
- Have everyone play someone else's blackjack game
    - Notice any bugs?
- Today we're basically going to do same thing
    - Instead of a new person playing, we're going to have a "rule bot"
- Rule bot description:
    - Similar to dealer
    - Hits up until it reaches a certain value
- Implementation
    - Create bot
    - Put in loop so can play a bunch of games and track wins/losses
    - For each "value" between 13-20:
        - Play 1000 games
        - Find win %
    - Graph with bar chart
    - Explain
- Go!
