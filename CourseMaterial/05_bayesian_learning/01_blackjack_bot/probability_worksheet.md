# Probability Tree Diagrams

## Independent Events 1

1. You have a bag with 4 blue marbles and 7 brown marbles. You pick two marbles,
   _replacing_ your choice each time. Draw a probability tree to represent this
   situation:
```






```

2. Why are these two events (two separate "picks") independent?
```

```

3. We want to calculate the probability of getting two blues in a row.
   **UNDERLINE** on your probability tree the **ONE NODE** that matches this
   description. Then, write the probability.
```

```

4. We want to calculate the probability of getting two browns in a row.
   **CIRCLE** on your probability tree the **ONE NODE** that matches this
   description. Then, write the probability.
```

```

## Independent Events 2

1. The probability of hitting a green light at two independent traffic signals
   is 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. Draw a probability tree to represent this
   situation:
```






```

2. We want to calculate the probability of getting two green lights in a row.
   **UNDERLINE** on your probability tree the **ONE NODE** that matches this
   description. Then, write the probability.
```

```

3. We want to calculate the probability of hitting at least one read light.
   **CIRCLE** on your probability tree the **THREE NODES** that match this
   description. Then, write the probability.
```

```

## Dependent Events 1

1. You have a bag with 4 blue marbles and 7 brown marbles. You pick two marbles,
   _without replacing_ your choice each time. Draw a probability tree to
   represent this situation:
```






```

2. Why are these two events (two separate "picks") dependent?
```

```

3. We want to calculate the probability of getting a brown first and a blue
   second. **UNDERLINE** on your probability tree the **ONE NODE** that matches
   this description. Then, write the probability.
```

```

4. We want to calculate the probability of getting one brown and one blue (in
   any order). **CIRCLE** on your probability tree the **TWO NODES** that match
   this description. Then, write the probability.
```

```

## Dependent Events 2

1. From a standard deck of 52 cards, you draw one card and then another without
   replacement. What is the probability that both cards are Aces?
```

```

2. Draw a probability tree to represents the above situation:
```






```

4. We want to calculate the probability of getting exactly two Aces. **UNDERLINE**
   on your probability tree the **ONE NODE** that matches this description.
   Then, write the probability.
```

```

4. We want to calculate the probability of getting exactly one Ace. **CIRCLE**
   on your probability tree the **TWO NODES** that match this description. Then,
   write the probability.
```
