# Bayes Theorem

## Independent Events 1

1. You have a bag with 6 blue marbles and 4 brown marbles. You pick two marbles,
   _replacing_ your choice each time. Draw a probability tree to represent this
   situation:
```







```

2. We want to calculate the probability of getting at least one brown.
   **UNDERLINE** on your probability tree the **THREE NODES** that match this
   description. Then, write the probability.
```

```

## Dependent Events 1

1. You have a bag with 6 blue marbles and 4 brown marbles. You pick two marbles,
   _without replacing_ your choice each time. Draw a probability tree to
   represent this situation:
```







```

2. We want to calculate the probability of getting two browns in a row.
   **UNDERLINE** on your probability tree the **ONE NODE** that matches this
   description. Then, write the probability.
```

```

3. We want to calculate `P(Blue Second | Brown First)`? **CIRCLE** on your
   probability tree the **TWO NODES** that match the "given". Then, calculate
   the probability.
```

```

4. We want to calculate `P(Brown First | Brown Second)`. **STAR** on your
   probability tree the **TWO NODES** that match the "given". Then, calculate
   the probability.
```

```

## Dependent Events 2

1. The probability that someone is a middle schooler is .4. If they are a middle
   schooler, the probability they play soccer is .8. If they are not a middle
   schooler, the probability they play soccer is .5. Draw a probability tree to
   represent this situation:
```







```

2. We want to calculate `P(Play soccer | Middle school)`. **UNDERLINE** on your
   probability tree the **TWO NODES** that match the "given". Then, calculate
   the probability.
```

```

3. We want to calculate `P(Middle school | Play Soccer)`. **CIRCLE** on your
   probability tree the **TWO NODES** that match the "given". Then, calculate
   the probability.
```

## Bayesian Data

Use the table representing whether a particular player made/missed a free throw
and in what half the free throw occurred to answer the following questions.

Player | Half | Result
-------|------|--------
Jordan | 1    |  Make
Jordan | 1    |  Make
Rose   | 1    |  Miss
Rose   | 2    |  Make
Jordan | 2    |  Make
Rose   | 2    |  Miss
Rose   | 1    |  Miss
Rose   | 1    |  Make
Jordan | 2    |  Miss
Jordan | 1    |  Make
Jordan | 1    |  Make


1. What is `P(Make)`?
```

```

2. What is `P(Make | Jordan)`.
```

```

3. Explain what you did to calculate the previous question and how the addition
   of the `|` made it different from the first question.
```

```

4. What is `P(Make | Rose in half 1)`?
```

```

5. Explain what you did to calculate the previous question and how the addition
   of the `|` made it different from the first question.
```

```

6. What is `P(Rose | Make)`?
```

```
