# Bayes Theorem

## Independent Events 1

1. You have a bag with 4 blue marbles and 7 brown marbles. You pick two marbles,
   _replacing_ your choice each time. Draw a probability tree to represent this
   situation:
```





```

2. What is the probability of picking two blue marbles?
```

```

3. Why are these two events (two separate "picks") independent?
```

```

## Independent Events 2

1. The probability of hitting a green light at two independent traffic signals
   is 0.5 and 0.4, respectively. Draw a probability tree to represent this
   situation:
```





```

2. What is the probability of hitting green lights at both signals?
```

```

3. What is the probability of hitting EXACTLY one red light?
```

```

## Dependent Events 1

1. You have a bag with 4 blue marbles and 7 brown marbles. You pick two marbles,
   _without replacing_ your choice each time. Draw a probability tree to
   represent this situation:
```





```

2. What is the probability of picking two blue marbles?
```

```

3. Why are these two events (two separate "picks") dependent?
```

```

4. What is `P(Blue Second | Brown First)`? In English, what is the probability of
   picking a blue marble given you picked a brown marble first?
```

```

5. What is `P(Brown Second | Blue First)`? Underline on your probability tree
   the **ONE NODE** that should be accounted for.
```

```

6. (BAYES RULE ALERT). What is `P(Brown First | Brown Second)`? Circle on your
   probability tree the **TWO NODES** that should be accounted for.
```

```

## Dependent Events 2

1. From a standard deck of 52 cards, you draw one card and then another without
   replacement. What is the probability that both cards are Aces?
```

```

2. Draw a probability tree to represents the above situation:
```





```

3. Why are these two events (two separate card draws) dependent?
```

```

4. What is `P(Ace Second | Ace First)`? In English, what is the probability of
   drawing an Ace given you previously drew an Ace?
```

```

5. What is `P(Ace Second | King First)`? Underline on your probability tree the
   **ONE NODE** that should be accounted for.
```

```

6. (BAYES RULE ALERT). What is `P(Ace First | Ace Second)`? Circle on your
   probability tree the **TWO NODES** that should be accounted for.
```

```

## Bayesian Data

Use the table representing whether a particular player made/missed a free throw
and in what half the free throw occurred.

Player | Half | Result
-------|------|--------
Jordan | 1    |  Make
Jordan | 1    |  Make
Rose   | 1    |  Miss
Rose   | 2    |  Make
Jordan | 2    |  Make
Rose   | 2    |  Miss
Rose   | 1    |  Miss
Rose   | 1    |  Make
Jordan | 2    |  Miss
Jordan | 1    |  Make
Jordan | 1    |  Make


1. What is `P(Make)`? In English, what is the probability of a free throw being made?
```

```

2. What is `P(Make | Jordan)`. In English, what is the probability a free throw
   being made given Jordan is the shooter?
```

```

3. Explain what you did to calculate the previous question.
```

```

4. What `P(Make | Rose in half 1)`?
```

```

5. Explain what you did to calculate the previous question.
```

```

6. What is `P(Rose | Make)`?
```
