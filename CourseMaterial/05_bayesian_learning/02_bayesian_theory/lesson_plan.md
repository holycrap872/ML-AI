## Essential Questions

- How can we use the past to predict the future?
- What are the fundamental symbols of bayesian probability?

## Lesson Plan

One assumption of this lesson is that we played a board game/card game with
some sort of Bayesian flare in the past. One example is the black-jack game.
Another example is Skull where the students kept track the actions each
person made (winter break filler activity).

Another assumption is that the students have a passing familiarity with
probability tree diagrams (either from a previous class or from the previous
nights homework).

### Setup

- Print out Bayesian Worksheet

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - What games have we played?
    - How did we make them bayesian?
    - Probability tree diagrams
- Markov models
    - Markov models look a heck of a lot like probability tree diagrams
- Independent events
    - Draw probability trees
        - Two coin flips
        - 3 blue, 1 brown w/ replacement
    - Calculate various probabilities
- Dependent events
    - Draw probability trees
        - 3 blue, 1 brown w/o replacement
    - Calculate various probabilities
        - P(Blue then Brown)
        - P(Exactly one Blue)
- Conditional Probability
    - Explain what it means
        - Given restricts (shrinks denominator)
    - Build on dependent events
        - P(Blue 2nd | Blue 1st)
        - P(Blue 1st | Blue 2nd)
- Bayesian formula
- Using data
    - Create a "batter" example where trying to predict chance of hit
    - Chance of a hit
    - Chance of a hit given it's Eric
    - Chance of a hit given it's Eric, given it's raining
- What is going on here?
    - Big idea of Bayesian Probability
        - Updating probabilities (denominator) based on what you know
- Do Bayesian worksheet in pairs
