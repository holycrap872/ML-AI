## Essential Questions

- How can we use the past to predict the future?
- What are the fundamental symbols of bayesian probability?

## Lesson Plan

The assumption of this lesson is that we played a board game/card game with
some sort of Bayesian flare in the past. One example is the black-jack game.
Another example is Skull where the students kept track the actions each
person made (winter break filler activity).

### Setup

- Print out Bayesian Worksheet

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - What games have we played?
    - How did we make them bayesian?
- Using data
    - Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results
- Bayesian symbols
    - Create a "batter" example where trying to predict chance of hit
    - Chance of a hit
    - Chance of a hit given it's Eric
    - Chance of a hit given it's Eric, given it's raining
- What is going on here?
- Classifier via Weka
- Do a few bayesian problems together on board
- Do Bayesian worksheet in pairs
