## Essential Questions

- What are the fundamental units of writing good programs?
- How do computers computerâ€™s actually work?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- `Human Resource Machine` game loaded up on computers
- c program available so can run `objdump`

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Named Tuples
- Play a game of NamedTuples Charades
    - Students come up with properties and class tries to guess name
- Next few days going to talk about how computers work at lowest level
    - Will be helpful for understanding chains of NamedTuples
    - See difference between primitives and other, more complicated data
- Today, going to play a game
    - Game very similar to how a CPU actually works
- Show `Human Resource Machine`
    - Walk through first few levels
    - Show how `jump`, `add`, memory work
- Reason we're doing this today:
    - Game very good representation of lowest level of computer
    - Help understand how memory works
    - Memory is a big list
    - Do simple program (`x = 1; x = x + 2; y = x;`)
- Have them start playing game
- Debrief
    - Show assembly language
    - This is literally what CPU runs
    - Show decompiled (`objdump`) code
