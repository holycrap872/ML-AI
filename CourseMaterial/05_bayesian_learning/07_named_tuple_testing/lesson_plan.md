## Essential Questions

- What are the fundamental units of writing good programs?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- `named_tuples_testing.py` loaded up to Schoology

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Bayes Theorem
    - Named Tuples
- Starting new unit (ish)
    - Bayes Theorem is done
    - Preparing for Trees
        - Trees are `NamedTuples` that point to the themselves
- Play a game of NamedTuples Charades
    - Students come up with properties and class tries to guess name
- Why am I so passionate about `NamedTuples`?
    - Essentials of good design
        - Identify data structures
        - Identify functions that operate on them
        - Create tests
    - Really not much else to do in programming
- What doing today
    - Have a bunch of code that needs better function names and tests
    - Walk through example
- TODO:
    - Create better names for functions in `named_tuples_testing.py`
    - Create two tests (T/F) for `named_tuples_testing.py`
    - Commit it
- Go!
