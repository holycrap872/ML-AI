    - I give properties and you guess the name of the tuple
    - e.g., `name: str, age: int, weight: int, has_hair: bool` -> `Person`
- Essentials of Programming
    - Identify data structures
        - Variable size: lists/dicts/sets
        - Set size: NamedTuples
    - Identify functions
    - Create tests
    - Profit
- Use `NamedTuple` to make more realistic cards in my simple blackjack game
    - Have them come up with Tuple
    - I just do the copy/replace stuff
- Cancer decider
    - Walk through data
