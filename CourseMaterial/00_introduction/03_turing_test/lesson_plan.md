## Essential Questions

- What signals do we use to determine intelligence?
- Where does intelligence lie?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Ear plugs/muffs to dampen sound
- Connection to ChatGPT
    - Prompt for chat GPT of the form:
```
Pretending to be a human high school student from Chicago who has one minute to
type an answer in order to illustrate the turing test, please answer the
following question: ..."
```

### Actual Lesson

- Refresher
    - What did we do yesterday?
    - What is a local maxima?
    - What do parameters mean?
    - What is max gradient ascent?
- ChatGPT intro
    - Look at the homework
    - We know ChatGPT is good at this kind of thing, so let's see what it says
        - Ask question on homework of ChatGPT
    - Today, going to see how smart ChatGPT is
- Who's heard of Alan Turing?
    - Why he's famous...
- Who's heard of the Turing test?
    - What it is...
    - Today we're going to simulate it
- Rules:
    - Volunteer to ask questions and volunteer to answer
    - Questioner stands with their back to the class with ear plugs/muffs on
    - Questioner asks a question
        - Answerer answers
        - Teacher types question into Chat-GPT
    - After 1m, teacher reads both answers
        - "Thing A says: ..."
        - "Thing B says: ..."
    - Once questioner thinks they know who's who, makes a guess
    - Once makes a guess, explains _why_ they made decision
    - Disallow that "type" of question and try again
        - Will eventually have list of types of questions that are disallowed
            - e.g., Doesn't know the name of the teacher -> no local context q's
- Go over list of types of questions and try to descibe why AI struggles with each
- Talk about the performance of difference chat bots over time

### Homework

Read:
    - Turing's `Computing Machinery and Intelligence` document?
    - intro of https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/ and be prepared to discuss
