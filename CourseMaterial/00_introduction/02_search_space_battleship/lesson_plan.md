## Essential Questions

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Bunch of sets of legos with green "baseplate" (32x32) to stick them to
- Dividers
- Pre-created "boards" (both 1d and 2d) to make clear what I'm talking about

### Actual Lesson

- Today going to play a game called "Search Space Battle Ship"
    - Who's played Battle Ship?
    - Explain Battle Ship
    - What are good strategies in Battle Ship?
- Most of ML/AI is trying to find the best possible solution
    - Parameters and objective function
    - Looking for a "global maxima"
    - Don't want to get stuck in a "local maxima"
    - Bunch of alogrithms to do this, but lets see what you come up with
- Rules
    - Play along one dimension
    - Board is 32 long (entire green lego baseplate)
    - Need to use between 35-40 legos
    - Must have a "peak" of height 5 that other person is trying to find
    - Must have at least two other "local" maximas
- Let play and debrief
    - What were people's strategies?
    - What was the hardest solution to find?
- Reset
    - Now going to play in 2d (12x12)
    - Set the parameters (in this case x,y)
    - Must have a maximum scope of 1
    - Must have one global maxima of height 5
    - Must have two other local maximas
- Let play and debrief
    - How many "parameters" in each game?
    - Gradient descent (ascent) in our case
        - https://youtu.be/IHZwWFHWa-w?t=420
    - What would "baking the perfect cake" look like?
        - What are some parameters?
        - Estimate of total number of parameters?
        - What is the objective function?

### Homework

- Research "simulated annealing" and explain what its strategy would be

    - One paragraph answering "What mistake did Prego make in terms of their objective function, when asking Howard Moskowitz to find the perfect sauce?"
